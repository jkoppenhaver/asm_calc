# asm_calc
This is just a simple calculator written in assembly as an experiment.  It does not provide any error checking or advanced functionality.  It only handles addition and subtraction of a result that fits in a 64 bit register.

The build bash script can be used to assamble and link the program.

## Expected Input
`<first number> <operator> <second number>\n`
